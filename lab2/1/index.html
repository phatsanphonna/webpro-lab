      Julius Robert Oppenheimer (born Julius Robert Oppenheimer; /ˈɒpənhaɪmər/ OP-ən-hy-mər; April 22, 1904 – February
      18, 1967) was an American theoretical physicist. He was director of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos
      Laboratory during World War II and is often called the "father of the atomic bomb".
    </p>

    <p>
      Born in New York City, Oppenheimer earned a bachelor of arts degree in chemistry from Harvard University in 1925
      and a doctorate in physics from the University of Göttingen in Germany in 1927, where he studied under Max Born.
      After research at other institutions, he joined the physics department at the University of California,
      Berkeley, where he became a full professor in 1936. He made significant contributions to theoretical physics,
      including achievements in quantum mechanics and nuclear physics such as the Born–Oppenheimer approximation for
      molecular wave functions, work on the theory of electrons and positrons, the Oppenheimer–Phillips process in
      nuclear fusion, and early work on quantum tunneling. With his students, he also made contributions to the theory
      of neutron stars and black holes, quantum field theory, and the interactions of cosmic rays.
